Final Project for Python Fundamentals Course

This project was the culminating program for my fundamentals course. 
I had the option to write a paper, I chose to write a program to further show
that I understood the basics of the Python language and how I would utilize them.
After completing this course I went to an Intermediate course and focused heavily
on data structures and algorithms.
