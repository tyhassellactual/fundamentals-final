I know, we aren't supposed to return strings in libraries,
but hear me out. I wanted to dempnstrate what I have learned.
Using this library and accesssing it through the final project shows
my ability to access data through user input and call it within a program 
linked only by importing the library.

# Lesson reflections

'''
Lesson one began with the install and very basic work understanding that even
my basic level of coding skill had already grasped. I forgot to pu my flowerbox but 
at least my instrutor took it easy on me and took my second submission since I was still
on time.
'''
def lesson1():
    reflections = "\n\tIn this assignment, I was fully prepared to kill it. I felt good \nand even moved forward to future assignments."
    return reflections
'''
Lesson two allowed me to used techniques I also already knew. Gaining input to 
define variables, creating some basic calculations with that input, and printing
the results to the user interface.
'''
def lesson2():
    reflections = "\n\tAssignment 2 increased my confidence that I was going to kill this course.\nI was 1/4 of the way complete and I was still ahead of the game."
    return reflections
'''
Lesson three left me reeling after seeing a FAT 60 on my initial grade. What had I done, I thought it was gonna be another
easy A. I mean, I had done this on week one because 'I knew' how to do this. Well requirements are important, so back
to the drawing board for me. My second submission, while better was not structured the way it should be. I reached out to the 
professor immediately and requested some extra attention. I could not bomb this course, for God's sakes this is what I was trying to 
do for a living and I am literally failing assignment 3 of the fundamentals! My professor was awesome, and we've been in contact ever 
since. I hope to always be in some way! Finished it out with an 80, but man some lessons were learned.
'''
def lesson3():
    reflections = "\n\tAssignment 3 crushed my ego, chewed me up and left me with the lowest B \npossible after MANY hours of work and study. I wasn't sure this was \nme anymore."
    return reflections
'''
Lesson four was all about exceptions and exception handling. My reusable functions returned text which was a no-no.
Well I'm doing it again now, and in a library, but it is for a purpose, so maybe I'll add a 'Final Project' to this 
when I'm done and annotate how bad he beats me up for being creative.
'''
def lesson4():
    reflections = "\n\tAssignment 4, I'm getting better at thinking like a programmer, but missing the why. Thankful for my mentor guiding me through."
    return reflections
'''
Lesson five let me work toward being a programmer by introducing me to creating and importing a library of my own. Overall it
was a success and allowed me to dive deeper into my program, although there were some things to work back from and my own learning
points
'''
def lesson5():
    reflections = "\n\tAssignment 5 had me feeling good and continuing to learn. Small changes and \nsyntax mistakes that are easily overcome. It was a good assignment for me."
    return reflections
''' 
Lesson six left me feeling good, but knowing I need to focus. It wasn't the best of weeks, but I trudged through
it and made it to the other side. I made similar mistakes to Assignment four, but in a different way.
no way I make that mistake again...or so I thought.
'''
def lesson6():
    reflections = "\n\tAssignment 6...So what do I do next, I don't even feel like I really know this yet. \nHow is ENTD320 just two weeks away?"
    return reflections
'''
Lesson 7 was really a crowing achivement. I fixed my mistakes from past weeks, earned a nearly perfect score needing no major adjustments to the score.
It really made me proud of myself. I also made a plan moving forward. Python- Flask -> Django, JavaScript- React, Data- PosgreSQL, MongoDB.
Feeling like I haev a plan, and this is achieveable.
'''
def lesson7():
    reflections = "\n\tYou know what? I CAN DO THIS. I have a plan, and before I really need to I will have the skills for me to \njump into tech and kill it!"
    return reflections
'''
Creating this final project is bitter sweet. This is the first programming/coding course where I really felt like I learned somehing.
There isn't much to say, other than I am appreciative for this course, and the instructor that has continued to lead me even though most of
the coursework is complete and turned in. Thank you for that. I also found out I have less time than I thought I would to get my crap together.
