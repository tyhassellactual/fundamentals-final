Program Architecture:
    A) Libraries: 
        assignmentLessonLib- Return reflections. (Bad for real programs, but just do it. It will perform fine for this.)
        techInterviewLib- Return answers to questions for technical Python knowledge part of assignment.
    B) Tests:
        menu_test- Test for menu display
        choice_test- Test for choice outcomes and exception handling
        assignment_test & techInterview_test- import appropriate libraries and use functions to check for cross-functionality
    c) Documentation- Completed with each step Completed
